        The only time you find yourself at the movies is when your friends drag you there...
        You go here and there, but only to see the big stuff everyone talks about so you are
        not out of the loop.

        You go to the movies a lot and you remember many facts about them and maybe even
        bother your friends with them. Maybe you can start a blog to share your thoughts
        on the current movies?

        Your parents and friends only vaguely remember what you like because you practically live
        in a movie theater. Everybody working there knows your name and you ask them how their children are...
        If you love movies so much, why don't you become a movie critic and start a blog or a youtube channel
        to share your thoughts with other movie buffs?
